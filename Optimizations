A note on optimizations incorporated into the tool
==================================================

a) Incremental discovery of disjuncts. Disjuncts are not just paths in the program they are also include predicates obtained by assertionizing the UIFs/ADTs/monotonicity properties.
b) Simplifying non-linear constraints using simple quantifier elimination rules of presburger arithmetic
c) Targetted unrolling (new)
d) Using CEGIS when non-linear solving timesout at a particular stage (not very helpful though)

TODO
====

d) Modular analysis for time bounds
e) Tightening the bound
