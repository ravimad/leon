\subsection{Abstract Refinement Types}

Abstract refinement types proposed by \cite{rjhala:ESOP13} are polymorphic dependent types analogous to polymorphic base types that enable quantification over the refinement predicates of dependent types. 
Polymorphism in dependent types is desirable for reasons similar to those of the base types. Consider the lambda term $\lambda x. x$. Clearly, it has the polymorphic 
type $a \mapsto a$. However, intuitively, the lambda term not only preserves the base types but also the dependent types regardless of the refinement predicate.
The type system proposed in the paper allows us to assign the lambda term an abstract refinement type of the form $\forall \pr{p::a \mapsto bool}. a\pr{p} \mapsto a\pr{p}$ where, $p$ is a predicate (boolean valued function) and $a\pr{p}$ denotes the dependent type $\dt{a}{p}$. $p$ is called an abstract refinement which can, in general, be a boolean valued function with any number of arguments.

The paper discusses three specific uses of abstract refinements namely, specifying and verifying key-value maps, recursive data structures refinements and higher-order traversal routines. Here, we illustrate the use of such abstract refinements for verifying key value maps.
