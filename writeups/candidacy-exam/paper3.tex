\subsection{Compositional Dependent Type Inference}

\cite{sujag:VMCAI13} propose a technique for automatic inference of refinement predicates 
using counterexample guided abstraction refinement. For open programs (that have
callers outside the analysis scope) their approach infers sufficiently strong types for the inputs 
that would guarantee type safety. 

The paper proposes an extension to the dependent types that
explicitly stores the calling context information in the types of the functions.
This lets their approach infer context sensitive dependent types.
(In principle, it is possible to distinguish between different calling contexts in dependent types 
using implication in the refinement predicates, however their extension makes this explicit.)
Under this extension, a function type is of the form $\{ x:P_1 \ctx P_2 \mapsto P_{r_1} \ctx P_{r_2}\}$ 
which means that the function has two contexts, in one context it has the type $\{x:P_1 \mapsto  P_{r_1} \}$ 
and in the other context it has the type $\{x:P_2 \mapsto  P_{r_2} \}$. Components in the function types
are indexed by an implicit label (e.g., a call-string).
