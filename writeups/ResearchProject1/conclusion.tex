\section{Conclusion} 

In this report, we presented and illustrated an algorithm for inferring inductive invariants for pure 
functional programs, that are strong enough to prove a given property, by inductive strengthening.
However, the algorithm applies only to monolithic programs having a single procedure.
In the future, we plan to extend the algorithm to programs with multiple procedures and also 
develop a prototype of the algorithm.
