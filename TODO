* Incorporate CEGAR using template based interpolant into the tool
* Perform modular analysis

Solve callees in isolation using templates. If the callee templates are not strong enough (i.e, if the caller verification did not succeed)
Try to find a stonger invariant belonging to the template for the callee, i.e, VC condition && (I_{new} ^ ~I_{old}) is unsat. But this may 
have a trivial solution which is I_{old}. Hence, we want (I_{old} ^ ~I_{new}) satisfiable. This can be added directly to the Farkas constraints.
Note that this has program variables which are integers. To solve this we can actually treat integers as reals. However, we may not be 
guaranteed to find stronger one. But will we eventually find one ? (unless the invariant polygon is bounded, finding a real is equivalent to finding an integer.)
If its a bounded polygon all that we need to do is check if its diameter is atleast one (this enforces an integer to be present in the polygon).
